# KawaiiWatermelon
For my final project in BCA Game Development, I recreated a minimalist puzzle game that I've always enjoyed playing during my free time. Drawing inspiration from the original, I added my own twist by introducing the Merge Force feature. Now, when two identical fruits merge, surrounding fruits receive a force boost. All the assets were meticulously crafted by me using Affinity Designer, resulting in a satisfying and engaging gameplay experience.
